Learning Journey at the Open University
Hello there! üëã Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I'm documenting my learning journey at the Open University. I'm currently a Level 2 student, and I'd like to share my experiences and the modules I've completed so far.

Completed Modules
2019 - Introduction to Computing and Information Technology 1 (TM111)
In 2019, I began my journey with TM111, which provided me with a solid foundation in computing and information technology. This module introduced me to programming using a Scratch-type interface, laying the groundwork for my coding skills.

2020 - Introduction to Computing and Information Technology 2 (TM112)
Building upon my TM111 experience, TM112 focused on the Python programming language. This module expanded my coding proficiency and deepened my understanding of programming concepts.

2021 - Technologies in Practice (TM129)
TM129 continued to enhance my Python skills while introducing networking concepts. This module prepared me for more advanced topics in networking, setting the stage for further exploration in subsequent modules.

2022 - Discovering Mathematics (MU123) and Cisco Networking (CCNA) Part 1 (TM257)
In 2022, I delved into mathematics with MU123 and concurrently pursued the Cisco CCNA Part 1 qualification with TM257. These modules broadened my mathematical knowledge and provided valuable insights into networking, laying the foundation for more advanced studies.

Current Modules
Object-Oriented Java Programming (M250)
I am currently engaged in M250, where I'm honing my Java programming skills. This module is a significant step forward in object-oriented programming, allowing me to expand my coding repertoire.

Web Technologies (TT284)
Simultaneously, I am exploring web technologies through TT284. This module is instrumental in enhancing my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and introducing me to PHP. The combination of these technologies equips me with the skills needed to develop dynamic and interactive web applications.

Overall Experience
My learning journey at the Open University has been dynamic and intellectually rewarding. From the fundamentals of programming to advanced networking and web technologies, each module has contributed to my growth as a computer science enthusiast. I look forward to further challenges and discoveries as I progress in my studies.
